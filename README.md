# CampusPandemicPlanR

This is a reinforcement learning-based simulation tool that could be applied to suggest to campus operators how many students from each course to allow on a campus classroom each week. The tool aims to strike a balance between the conflicting goals of keeping students from getting infected, on one hand, and allowing more students to come into campus to allow them to benefit from in-person classes, on the other. It incorporates the following:
<ol>
<li>A general campus model that includes students, teachers, courses and classrooms</li>
<li>COVID-19 transmission model that estimates the number of infected students in an indoorroom/li>
</ol>
